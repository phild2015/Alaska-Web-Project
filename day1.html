  <p>When I arrived at the Anchorage airport and went to pick up my car rental, I was upgraded to a Mustang for no additional charge because there were no Economy cars left.  Off to a good start! Great American car for a classic American road trip.  I grabbed a midnight breakfast at a greasy spoon diner in the city and immediately hit the road Denali bound.  On the way up the signs of civilization start to slowly disappear until it's just you and the road, the beautiful scenery and the occasional caravan of RVs. Passing these on a two lane is usually a bit nerve racking but the 300 HP of the Mustang made it a pleasure, easily passing up to three at a time.  Arriving to Denali National Park in the late afternoon I set up camp, went for a quick walk to check out the XXX river and hit the sack.  First thing in the morning I had an appointment at the Rangers cabin for wilderness briefing.  I was designated a zone, a giant glacial valley along the XXX river, deep into the park.  I watched a hilarious video on safe practices including how to cross glacial rivers and surviving a bear attack, and was given my bear-resistant food (and poop) container.  It is the same container.  You are supposed to keep your poop with your food.  The rangers made sure I left them my itinerary so they could call a search party if I didn't show up at Wonderlake by X date and wished me luck.  I was going to be on my own, deep in the Alaskan wilderness. Took a short hike to get warmed up and ran into moose (pic checkpoint and moose) marmot and chipmunk and porcupine.  Goosebumps and butterflies for next day - on my own out in the wild. </p>
